# Skill-Matcher
Skill Matcher is a web application that allows you to easily create and fill out teams!

### As a team leader:
Log in to skill matcher and create a team! We'll provide you with a shareable link that you can give others.
When others sign up for your team, they'll provide you with an email you can use to contact them!
When creating a team, list the skills you need from potential members!

### As a team member:
Make sure you are logged in or registered before opening a join link!
Once you are logged in and go to the join link, enter the email that you would like to be contacted through!
Wait for a response from the team leader!
